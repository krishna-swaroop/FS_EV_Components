# FS_EV_Components
This repository contains files for controlling various components that I designed for the Electric Vehicle to be manufactured by Inspired Karters FS, BITS Pilani for the Formula Bharat Electric Vehicle 2020 competition.
This repository will contain controlling codes for the various components of the shutdown circuit.
Most of these assume that the reader has separate microcontrollers for each component. Although the car we designed will run these codes simultaneously, the codes have been published separately to cater to potential needs of the reader. Try contacting for help regarding integration of these codes.
